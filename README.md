# Overview

This game is a platformer demo created to test creating platformer mechanics akin to both Super Mario and Getting Over It.
Arrow keys for moving the player, space for jump, Q for run, and move the mouse for controlling the flying hammer's position. The flying hammer takes 5 swings before being discarded and taking a hammer mushroom while having an active flying hammer will regenerate the hammer back to 5 health points; Say that you have used up 3 swings on your hammer, you will get those three swings back when you pick up a hammer mushroom. Black boxes will kill the player no matter if they have grown larger due to the super mushroom.
